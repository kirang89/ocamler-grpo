oss_14666,"You are given a list of integers representing the daily stock prices of a company. Write a function `max_profit(prices: List[int]) -> int` that takes in a list of integers `prices`, where each index `i` represents the price of the stock on day `i`. The function should return the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling the stock once. The buying price must occur before the selling price. If it is not possible to make a profit, return 0. For example, given the input `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`, the function should return `5`, because the maximum profit can be obtained by buying on day 2 at price 1 and selling on day 5 at price 6."

The function should take one parameter, `arr`, which is a list of integers. It should return a new list that contains the elements of `arr` sorted in ascending order. The cycle sort algorithm minimizes the number of writes performed. Note that the input list may contain duplicate elements.

The paths will always start with a forward slash ('/'). The function signature is as follows: `def file_system_operations(operations: List[Tuple[str, str, str]]) -> List[List[str]]:` where operations is a list of tuples, each containing the operation type ('create_directory', 'create_file', 'list_directory', 'navigate'), the path, and content if applicable (for create_file only)."

oss_14932,"You are working on a project involving depth cameras and image processing. The goal is to manipulate the image coordinates and reshape them for further processing. You have a depth camera with dimensions `image_size_x` and `image_size_y`. Write a function `reshape_image_coordinates(image_size_x, image_size_y)` that takes in the dimensions of the depth camera image and returns a reshaped array of image coordinates. The reshaping process involves generating a 1D array of image coordinates ranging from `image_size_x - 1` to 0, and repeating this array `image_size_y` times to match the dimensions of the image. For example, if `image_size_x = 3` and `image_size_y = 2`, the reshaped array of image coordinates would be `[2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]`."

Your goal is to create a custom exception class named `MinosMalformedAttributeException`, which should inherit from the `MinosModelAttributeException` class. The `MinosModelAttributeException` class is already provided and has an `__init__` method that takes three parameters: `name` (the name of the attribute), `target_type` (the expected type of the attribute), and `value` (the actual value of the attribute). The `__init__` method constructs an error message indicating that the expected type does not match the given data type. Your `MinosMalformedAttributeException` class should inherit from `MinosModelAttributeException` and should not require any additional methods or attributes beyond what is inherited. When an instance of `MinosMalformedAttributeException` is raised, it should provide an error message in the format: 'The {target_type} expected type for {name} does not match with the given data type: {value}'.

oss_15257,"You are tasked with creating a function that takes a list of items and returns a new list containing only the unique items from the original list, preserving the order of their first occurrence. Implement a function named `unique_items` that accepts a single parameter, `items`, which is a list of strings. The function should return a list of strings that contains each unique item from the input list in the order they first appeared.

The file paths will be formed by concatenating the base path with each module name, separated by a forward slash. Implement the function `generate_file_paths(app_modules: List[str], base_path: str) -> List[str]` that accomplishes this task.

oss_16064,"You are tasked with implementing a function that takes in a list of strings and returns the count of unique strings in the list. A unique string is one that appears only once in the list, ignoring case sensitivity. For instance, 'Hello' and 'hello' should be considered the same string. Implement the following function: 

```python

Example:
```python
