oss_0,"Given a list of strings, implement a function `find_palindromes` that returns a new list containing only the strings that are palindromes. A palindrome is defined as a word that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring case and spaces. For example, if the input list is `['radar', 'hello', 'level', 'world', 'Anna']`, the function should return `['radar', 'level', 'Anna']`. Your function should handle empty strings and variations in case appropriately."
oss_1,"You are tasked with implementing a parser for a simple programming language that recognizes four types of tokens: 'daddress', 'dcommand', 'doaddress', and 'dosymbol'. Each token is represented as a tuple, where the first element is a string indicating the type of the token, and the second element is the token's value. Your task is to implement a function called `parse_tokens` that takes a list of these token tuples and returns a list of the same tuples.

If the token is not in the expected format or the authorization type is unsupported, the function should raise a ValueError with the appropriate error message. The function should adhere to the following requirements: 
1. If the authorization header is missing or in an invalid format (e.g., missing token or incorrect prefix), raise a ValueError with the message 'invalid authorization header'. 
2. If the token is in the correct format and authorization type, return the token. 
3. The expected authorization type prefix is 'Bearer'.

The setup file will include a package name, version, author, and a list of install requirements in the format 'package_name>=version' or 'package_name<version'. Write a function `parse_setup_file(code_snippet: str) -> dict` that implements this functionality. For example, given the input string '\nfrom setuptools import setup\nattrs = {\n    'name': 'my_package',\n    'install_requires': ['requests>=2.20.0', 'flask<2.0.0']\n}\nsetup(name=attrs['name'], install_requires=attrs['install_requires'])', the expected output should be {'my_package': [('requests', '>=2.20.0'), ('flask', '<2.0.0')]}"
oss_134,"You are tasked with implementing a function that processes a given HTML snippet and extracts the plain text content from it. Your function should ignore all HTML tags and return only the text between them. Write a function `extract_plain_text(html_snippet: str) -> str` that takes a string `html_snippet` representing a portion of an HTML document and returns the extracted plain text content. The HTML snippet may contain various HTML tags, including but not limited to <p>, <div>, <span>, and <br>. Make sure to handle cases where there are nested tags or multiple elements on the same line. Example: If the input is '<div>Hello <strong>World</strong>!</div>', the output should be 'Hello World!'."
oss_137,"You are tasked with creating a function that returns the first n prime numbers as a list. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. Your function should take an integer n as input and return a list containing the first n prime numbers. For example, if n = 5, the output should be [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]. Implement a function named `get_first_n_primes(n: int) -> List[int]` that takes an integer n and returns a list of the first n prime numbers."
oss_138,"You are tasked with implementing a function that calculates the sum of all even numbers from a given list of integers. The function should take a single parameter, a list of integers, and return the sum of all even integers in that list. If there are no even integers, the function should return 0. The function should not handle any input errors as it is assumed that the input will always be a valid list of integers. Implement the function `sum_of_evens(nums: List[int]) -> int:` where `nums` is the list of integers. "
oss_140,"You are tasked with implementing a function that simulates the creation of chat groups for a chat application. The function `create_chat_group(group)` takes a dictionary representing the details of a chat group and returns a tuple containing the status code of the operation and the number of results generated from the creation. The function should follow these criteria: 1. If the group's name is 'Group 1' and it has exactly 2 members, it should return a status code of 200 and results as 2. 2. If the group's name is 'Group 2' and it has 3 members, it should return a status code of 200 and results as 3. 3. For any other group details, it should return a status code of 400 and results as 0. Your task is to implement the `create_chat_group` function to meet the above specifications."
oss_142,"You are tasked with implementing a function that calculates the total profit from a series of trades. Each trade can either be a profit or a loss, represented by an integer value. You will receive a list of integers where each integer represents the profit (positive value) or the loss (negative value) of a trade. Your goal is to return the total profit by summing up all the values in the list. If the total is negative, you should return 0 instead. Write a function called `calculate_total_profit(trades: List[int]) -> int` that takes in a list of integers and returns the total profit as described."
oss_144,"You are tasked with creating a function that simulates port scanning on a target host. The function should take in a target host as a string and a list of ports. For each port in the list, it should print whether the port is 'open' or 'closed'. Assume that ports 80, 443, and 22 are 'open', and all other ports are 'closed'. Your function should handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the scanning process by printing an error message. Implement the function `simulate_port_scan(target: str, ports: List[int]) -> None` that performs these actions."
